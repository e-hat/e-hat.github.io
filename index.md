Hey, I'm Eddie. I like programming, video games, tennis, nature, dogs, music, tv shows, linux, and math. I also like learning about and being in nature.

Sometimes I write stuff on this blog that people probably don't read. 

IRL I am a CS student at Tufts in my fourth-year.

I made all of the terrible art you see on this webstie and I'm more proud of it than anything else.

The source code lives [here](https://github.com/e-hat/e-hat.github.io). 
Check it out if you want to contribute or if you want my art (seriously?).
