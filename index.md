Hey, I'm Eddie. I like programming, video games, tennis, nature, dogs, music, tv shows, linux, and math. 

<br/>
I'm [e-hat](https://github.com/e-hat) on Github and I'm usually building something over there. Right now I'm working on a 
compiler for this programming language I'm making called [Plume](https://github.com/e-hat/plume).

<br/>
Sometimes I write stuff on this blog that people probably don't read. 

<br/>
IRL I am a CS student at Tufts. Right now I'm on a leave of absence to do an internship at [Shoreline.io](https://www.shoreline.io). This summer I'll be interning at Google.

This terrible art you see before your eyes? I made it BY HAND (read "with GIMP") and I'm more proud of it than anything else.

The blog itself is made with Jekyll, which is SO FUN. I get carried away making this website unnecessarily modular.

The source code lives [here](https://github.com/e-hat/e-hat.github.io). 
Check it out if you want to contribute or if you want my art (seriously?).
